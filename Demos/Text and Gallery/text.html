                healthcare, battle poverty, protect the environment, and so much more.</p>

                become more efficient. Construct health information systems that will study the needs of doctors,
                nurses, patients, and health care organizations. Take technology into the natural world to help map the
                human genome or develop ways to create clean, renewable energy.</p>
